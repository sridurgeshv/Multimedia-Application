### Multimedia-Application
Welcome to the Multimedia-Application GitHub repository, showcasing a comprehensive application with support for image, video, audio, and document files.\
We initially developed a simple header component named "Header" in JavaScript, containing our name and initial letter. For this local application, we generated data in another JavaScript file called "data." This file stores file details (path, name, type) on a database, while the actual files are stored in a storage drive like Google Drive. The web application features custom components for displaying videos, images, documents, and audio: Video Component, Audio Component, Document Component, and Image Component.Here our application offers four functions: Rename files, Delete files, View file type breakdown, and Download files.

Now we deploy it on Google Firebase, a dependable web hosting provider known for its robust features like real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions, ensuring scalability and top-notch performance.
