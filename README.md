<h1>Multimedia-Application</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Multimedia-Application GitHub repository, showcasing a comprehensive application with support for image, video, audio, and document files.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>The foundation of this project began with the creation of a JavaScript-based "Header" component, a simplistic yet essential element displaying our team's name and initials. Additionally, we developed a JavaScript file named "data" to manage file details (such as path, name, type), storing this information in a database while the actual files reside in storage, such as Google Drive.</p>

<p>The application is designed with custom components tailored for handling various file types:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Video Component</strong>: Enables seamless video playback within the application.</li>
  <li><strong>Audio Component</strong>: Provides an integrated audio player for audio file streaming.</li>
  <li><strong>Document Component</strong>: Renders documents with supported formats for easy viewing.</li>
  <li><strong>Image Component</strong>: Allows smooth image display and manipulation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Application Functions</h2>
<p>Our application extends functionality across four key areas:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Rename Files</strong>: Allows users to modify file names for better organization and identification.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete Files</strong>: Provides the capability to remove unwanted files securely.</li>
  <li><strong>View File Type Breakdown</strong>: Presents a breakdown of file types, aiding in understanding file distribution.</li>
  <li><strong>Download Files</strong>: Facilitates hassle-free downloading of files from the application interface.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Deployment on Google Firebase</h2>
<p>We chose Google Firebase for deploying our application, leveraging its robust features like real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions. This choice ensures scalability and high-performance delivery.</p>
