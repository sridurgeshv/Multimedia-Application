## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the Multimedia Application GitHub repository. This documentation provides an in-depth overview of our comprehensive application designed to support various file types, including images, videos, audios, and documents.

## 2. Project Overview

The Multimedia Application project originated with the development of a JavaScript-based "Header" component, serving as a fundamental yet vital element displaying our team's name and initials. Furthermore, we created a JavaScript file named "data" to manage file details such as path, name, and type, storing this information in a database while the actual files reside in storage, such as Google Drive.

The application is equipped with custom components tailored to handle different file types:

- **Video Component**: Enables seamless video playback within the application.
- **Audio Component**: Provides an integrated audio player for streaming audio files.
- **Document Component**: Renders documents with supported formats for easy viewing.
- **Image Component**: Allows smooth display and manipulation of images.

## 3. Application Functions

Our application extends functionality across four key areas:

1. **Rename Files**: Allows users to modify file names for better organization and identification.
2. **Delete Files**: Provides the capability to securely remove unwanted files.
3. **View File Type Breakdown**: Presents a breakdown of file types, aiding in understanding file distribution.
4. **Download Files**: Facilitates hassle-free downloading of files from the application interface.

## 4. Deployment on Google Firebase

We selected Google Firebase for deploying our application due to its robust features such as real-time database, authentication, and cloud functions. This choice ensures scalability and high-performance delivery.
